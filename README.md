# Placement-Predictor-Using-Machine-Learning

The placement of students is one of the most important outcomes for any educational institution, and predicting whether a student will get placed is a challenging task. This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based placement prediction system that forecasts the probability of a final-year student securing a job offer based on various factors such as academic performance, internships, extracurricular activities, and personal background. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in solving real-world problems in the educational sector. By accurately predicting student placements, educational institutions can provide better career guidance, focus on skill development, and improve student outcomes.

Keywords: Placement prediction, machine learning, KNN, Random Forest, AdaBoost, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning.
